# Generator Frontend

This is a Yo generator to help kick off frontend web development projects. It's designed to follow the conventions and patterns I choose personally and will probably change a lot over time.

## Features

### Always:
- Process CSS with Stylus
- Autoprefix CSS
- Uglify and CSSMin

### Optionally:
- Use Jade
- Include jQuery (at specified version)
- Use livereload (on specified port)
- Initialise a new Git repo

## Todo
- Create Gulp version
- Implement [CSSO](http://css.github.io/csso/)
