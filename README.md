# Generator Frontend

This is a Yeoman generator to help kick off frontend web development projects. It's designed to follow the conventions and patterns I choose personally and will probably change a lot over time.

- Use Jade or plain ol' HTML
- Uses Stylus always
- Uses Autoprefixer always
- Uses Bower
- Uglify and CSSMin
- Optionally include jQuery (at specified version)
- Optionally use livereload (on specified port)
- Optionally initialise a new Git repo
